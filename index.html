                        transition and
                        have
                        heard
                        some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
                        it
                        incredibly
                        fun! I enrolled shorly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the bes - and most grueling - time of
                        my life.
                        Since
                        completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
                        VR
                        startup."

                student of
                theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. the entire curriculum and project, in
                particular,
                was outstanding. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                offers.
                100% recommend!"
